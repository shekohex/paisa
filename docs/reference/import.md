# Import

Paisa provides ability to convert **CSV**, **TXT**, **XLS**, **XLSX**
or **PDF** files to Ledger file format. The import page is made of
three components.

!!! example "Experimental"
    PDF support is in an experimental stage and may not accurately detect rows.


1) File Preview - You can drag and drop files here to preview the
contents.

2) Ledger Preview - This is where the converted ledger file will be
shown.

3) Template Editor - This is where you can edit the template.

Each row in the CSV file is converted to a transaction in the
ledger. This conversion is controlled by the template.

```handlebars
{{#if (and (isDate ROW.A "DD/MM/YYYY") (isBlank ROW.G))}}
 {{date ROW.A "DD/MM/YYYY"}} {{ROW.C}}
    {{predictAccount prefix="Expenses"}}		{{ROW.F}} INR
    Assets:Checking
{{/if}}
```

Let's break this down. The first line is a conditional statement. It
checks if the row has a date in the first column. You can refer any
column using their alphabets. The second line constructs the
transaction header. The third line constructs the first posting. The
fourth line constructs the second posting.

Effectively a single row in the CSV file is converted to a single
transaction like this.

```ledger
2023/03/28 AMAZON HTTP://WWW.AM IN
    Expenses:Shopping		249.00 INR
    Assets:Checking
```

The template is written in [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/). Paisa provides a few
helper functions to make it easier to write the template.

#### Template Management

Paisa ships with a few built-in templates. You can also create your
own. To create a new template, edit the template and click on the
`Save As` button. User defined custom templates are stored in the
configuration file.

!!! tip
    The import system is designed to be extensible and might not be
    intuitive if you are not accustomed to coding. If you are unable
    to create a template suitable for your file, please open an issue
    with a sample file, and we will provide assistance, possibly
    adding it to the built-in templates.

#### Template Data

1. **ROW** - This is the current row being processed. You can refer to
    any column using their alphabets. For example, `ROW.A` refers to
    the first column, `ROW.B` refers to the second column and so
    on. The current row index is available as `ROW.index`.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```json
{
  "A": "28/03/2023",
  "B": "7357680821",
  "C": "AMAZON HTTP://WWW.AM IN",
  "D": "12",
  "E": "0",
  "F": "249.00",
  "G": "",
  "index": 6
}
```
</details>

2. **SHEET** - This is the entire sheet. It is an array of rows. You
   can refer a specific cell using the following syntax `SHEET.5.A`.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```json
[
    {
        "A": "Accountno:",
        "B": "49493xxx003030",
        "index": 0
    },
    {
        "A": "Customer Name:",
        "B": "MR John Doe",
        "index": 1
    },
    {
        "A": "Address:",
        "B": "1234, ABC Street, XYZ City, 123456",
        "index": 2
    },
    {
        "A": "Transaction Details:",
        "index": 3
    },

        "F": "Amount(in Rs)",
        "G": "BillingAmountSign",
        "index": 4
    },
    {
        "A": "49493xxx003030",
        "index": 5
    },
    {
        "A": "28/03/2023",

        "index": 6
    },
    {
        "A": "28/03/2023",
        "B": "7357821997",
        "C": "AMAZON HTTP://WWW.AM IN",
        "D": "28",

]
```

#### Template Helpers

#### `#!typescript eq(a: any, b: any): boolean`

Checks if the two values are equal.

#### `#!typescript not(value: any): boolean`

Negates the given value.

#### `#!typescript and(...args: any[]): boolean`

Returns true if all the arguments are true.

#### `#!typescript or(...args: any[]): boolean`

Returns true if any of the arguments are true.

#### `#!typescript gte(a: string | number, b: string | number): boolean`

Checks if a is greater than or equal to b.

#### `#!typescript gt(a: string | number, b: string | number): boolean`

Checks if a is greater than b.

#### `#!typescript lte(a: string | number, b: string | number): boolean`

Checks if a is less than or equal to b.

#### `#!typescript lt(a: string | number, b: string | number): boolean`

Checks if a is less than b.

#### `#!typescript max(...args: (string | number)[]): number`

Finds the maximum value from the given values.

#### `#!typescript min(...args: (string | number)[]): number`

Finds the minimum value from the given values.

#### `#!typescript add(a: string | number, b: string | number): number`

Adds the given values. `(a + b)`

#### `#!typescript sub(a: string | number, b: string | number): number`

Subtracts the given values. `(a - b)`


#### `#!typescript mul(a: string | number, b: string | number): number`

Multiplies the given values. `(a * b)`

#### `#!typescript div(a: string | number, b: string | number): number`

Divides the given values. `(a / b)`

#### `#!typescript negate(value: string | number): number`

Negates the given value. For example, `negate("123.45")` will return
`-123.45`

#### `#!typescript amount(str: string, {default?: string}): string`

Converts the given string to a valid amount. If the string is blank,
the default value is used. Examples `(0.9534)` to `-0.9534`, `â‚¹
1,234.56` to `1234.56`

#### `#!typescript round(str: string, {precision?: number}): number`

Rounds the given value to the given precision. If precision is not
set, defaults to `0`

#### `#!typescript isDate(str: string, format: string): boolean`

Checks if the given string is a valid date in the given format. Refer
[Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/string-format#list-of-all-available-parsing-tokens) for the full list of supported formats.

#### `#!typescript predictAccount(...terms: string[], {prefix?: string}): string`

Helps with prediction of account name to be used in a
transaction. Let's say you import your Credit Card bill, you would
prefer the system to automatically assign the account name for
you. `predictAccount` acts like a search engine. It will try to find a
transaction that is similar to the current transaction. The search
requires input (referred as terms) and it will match transactions with
similar **description** and will pick the accounts from the top match.

If `terms` are not provided, the entire `ROW` will be used.

The `prefix` is optional and will be used to filter out matching
accounts. If no match is found, `Unknown` will be returned.

```handlebars
{{predictAccount prefix="Income"}}
{{predictAccount ROW.C ROW.F prefix="Income"}}
```

!!! tip

    Prediction will only work if you have similar transactions in
    ledger file. It usually means, first time you have to manually fix
    the Unknown account and then subsequent imports will work

#### `#!typescript isBlank(str: string): boolean`

Checks if the given string is blank.

#### `#!typescript date(str: string, format: string): string`

Parses the given string as a date in the given format and returns the
date in the format `YYYY/MM/DD`. Refer [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/string-format#list-of-all-available-parsing-tokens) for the full list
of supported formats.

#### `#!typescript findAbove(column: string, {regexp?: string}): string`

Finds the first cell above the current row in the given column. If
`regexp` is provided, the search will continue till a match is found

```handlebars
{{findAbove B regexp="LIMITED"}}
```

#### `#!typescript findBelow(column: string, {regexp?: string}): string`

Finds the first cell below the current row in the given column. If
`regexp` is provided, the search will continue till a match is found

```handlebars
{{findBelow B regexp="LIMITED"}}
```

#### `#!typescript acronym(str: string): string`

Returns the acronym of the given string that is suitable to be used as
a commodity symbol. For example, `UTI Nifty Next 50 Index Growth
Direct Plan` will be converted to `UNNI`

#### `#!typescript replace(str: string, search: string, replace: string): string`

Trims the given string.

#### `#!typescript regexpTest(str: string, regexp: string): boolean`

Tests the given string against the given regular expression.


#### `#!typescript regexpMatch(str: string, regexp: string, {group?: number}): string`

Extract part of a string. Let's say you have `Axis Long Term
  Equity Growth Direct Plan` and you want to extract `Axis Long Term
  Equity`, you can use `#!handlebars {{regexpMatch ROW.C "(.*) Growth Direct Plan" group=1}}` assuming the string is in the column
  `C`. `group` is optional and defaults to `0`.


#### `#!typescript textRange(fromColumn: string, toColumn: string, {separator?: number}): string`

Extracts text from the given range of columns. The `separator` is
optional and defaults to `" "`.

```handlebars
{{textRange A C separator=" "}}
```

#### `#!typescript toLowerCase(str: string): string`

Converts the given string to lower case.

#### `#!typescript toUpperCase(str: string): string`

Converts the given string to upper case.

#### `#!typescript match(str: string, {[string]: string}): string`

Let's say you are trying to import your Credit Card bill and you want
map the transaction to a specific expense account based on the
description. You can use the `match` helper to do that. The helper
takes a string and a map of key value pairs. The key is the account to
be returned if the string matches the value. The value must be a valid
regular expression.

```handlebars
{{match ROW.C Expenses:Shopping="Amazon|Flipkart" Expenses:Groceries="BigBasket"}}
```

In case of no match `null` will be returned. You can combine this
with `or` helper to return a default account.

```handlebars
{{or (match ROW.C Expenses:Shopping="Amazon|Flipkart" Expenses:Groceries="BigBasket")
     "Expenses:Unknown"}}
```
